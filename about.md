Hi, I'm Alberto. I love making robots.

I work at [IIT](http://www.iit.it) as the lead hardware specialist of the [iCub](http://www.icub.org) and [R1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBphNGW6m4o) projects.

I strive to design mechanisms with complex behavior in minimal embodiments, for achieving high efficiency, improved interaction, at reduced cost.

In my spare time I love writing Python code, drawing, and reading.
