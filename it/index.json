For this, several Parallel Kinematic Mechanisms (PKMs) were considered, namely a 4-UU mechanism, a spherical 5-bar mechanism and a spherical 6-bar mechanism, with gimbal-like rotations. Computer-Aided Design (CAD) modelling and simulations exploring the workspaces for each of these mechanisms was performed. The complete workspace and isotropy analyses comparing these mechanisms to a gimbal system are presented. The general observations suggest that these mechanisms posses a non-uniform workspace with a \"warping\" behaviour. However, the spherical six bar mechanism proves to be the best solution so far with isotropy nearly = 0.9 throughout its workspace.","tags":["spherical parallel mechanisms","workspace analysis","CAD simulation","mechanism design"],"title":"Comparison of Workspace Analysis for Different Spherical Parallel Mechanisms","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"More recently, our group started directing part of its effort to the study and development of two degrees of freedom (DOF) mechanisms to be employed as robot wrists.

These characteristics make them ideal for applications in robot wrists. This article presents the detailed kinematic and workspace analysis for four N-UU class mechanisms. More in detail, the equations defining the mechanismï¿½s moving platform kinematics are derived as a function of the motion of the input links; these are then used to explore the mechanismï¿½s workspace. These results are furthermore validated by comparing them to the results obtained from CAD-based simulations. The analyses suggests that the workspace of the mechanism is non-uniform, with a ï¿½warpingï¿½ behaviour that occurs in an asymmetric fashion in a specific region of the workspace. Furthermore we show how the rotation of the input links, which mainly actuates the yaw and pitch angles of the mechanism, also causes unwanted coupled rotations along the roll axis.","tags":null,"title":"Workspace Analysis and the Effect of Geometric Parameters for Parallel Mechanisms of the N-UU Class","type":"publication"},{"authors":["L.

The ambitious aim of the project was to design, build and demonstrate a robot functionally equivalent to the iCub humanoid but at one-twentieth (1\u0026frasl;20) of the cost.\nThis goal was pursued with a design-for-manufacturing approach, novel solutions for robot mechanisms, and by a wide use of polymeric materials.\nThe project was of a rather large scale, involving over 30 people working in 7 different institutions in different geographical locations (Italy, Spain, Switzerland and New Zealand). The total budget of the project was around 1.1M€ (including personnel, consumables, and external services).\nDuring this period, I managed the project and acted as the main reference person for all development related issues. As part of my project management duty, I introduced an AGILE working methodology, which largely increased the efficiency and proficiency of the development team. I personally designed several robot sub-assemblies. Over the course of 16 months, we developed from scratch three new types of robotic actuators and a novel motor control methodology.\nThe first prototype of the R1 robot was demonstrated in April 2016.

Besides the original design work, I integrated advanced sensing solutions developed by colleagues specializing in micro-electronics. The new version of the robot integrated an improved system for the position sensing of the electric motor rotors, field oriented control for the brushless DC motors, additional acceleration and angular velocity MEMS sensors, and a full-body skin with approximately 4000 independent pressure measurement points. A detailed description of the results of the project is presented in:\nParmiggiani, A., Maggiali, M., Natale, L., Nori, F., Schmitz, A., Tsagarakis, N., … Metta, G. (2012).
