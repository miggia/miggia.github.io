      <description>&lt;p&gt;The goal of the R1 project was to bring the technology developed in the iCub project one step closer to the market. This problem was addressed with a design-for-manufacturing approach, novel solutions for robot mechanisms, and by a wide use of polymeric materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project was of a rather large scale, involving over 30 people working in 7 different institutions in different geographical locations (Italy, Spain, Switzerland and New Zealand). The total budget of the project was around 1.1Mâ‚¬ (including personnel, consumables, and external services).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first complete robot prototype was demonstrated in April 2016, just 16 months after the beginning of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The iCub is a 53DOF open-source humanoid robot. Since 2007 In the years from 2007 to 2019 I have been heavily involved in the design and testing of several of its parts. Among these, the upper-body, the legs, the six-axis force-torque sensors, the covers, the legs, the hands and forearms, and the head. Since 2010, until September 2019 I have served the role of hardware lead of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More details about the robot can be found on the project website: &lt;a href=&#34;www.icub.org&#34;&gt;www.icub.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
