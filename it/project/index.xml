      <title>AM of compliant mechanisms</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The recent advent of Additive Manufacturing (AM) has fundamentally changed the way we manufacture things. From design to tooling to replacement parts, additive manufacturing affected most areas of engineering. However, its impact on the field of robotics is just beginning to be felt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designing, fabricating and assembling articulated robots is a long and complex process. The clever application of AM can, however, overcome part of these difficulties. For example, robots with lower part counts can be designed specifically for AM, requiring little or no assembly operations. Furthermore, compliant joints can be used to replace traditional multi-part revolute or linear joints. Finally, the local tuning of material properties is now possible, thanks to the advent of new machines allowing fabrication with multiple materials and long-fibre composites. These possibilities open the way for integrated, high-performance monolithic robotic systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project aims to rethink the way we currently design and make robots by developing new approaches for their implementation, taking advantage of the possibilities of AM.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CF-AM</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since 2015, several companies have developed systems for the fabrication of composite parts employing the technology commonly named continuous fiber additive manufacturing (CF-AM). This is substantially an evolution of FFF, whereby continuous high-resistance fibers are deposited together with a thermoplastic material acting as the matrix of the composite. This process yields components having remarkable mechanical properties in the direction of the reinforcement fibers. In this project we are carrying out several experimental activities aimed at defining the capabilities and limitations of this technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project is carried out in collaboration with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.iit.it/web/materials-characterization&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;IIT&amp;rsquo;s material characterization facility&lt;/a&gt; and the Department of Mechanical Engineering (DIME), of the University of Genoa.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>R1</title>
      <link>https://miggia.github.io/it/project/r1/</link>

      <guid>https://miggia.github.io/it/project/r1/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The goal of the R1 project was to bring the technology developed in the iCub project one step closer to the market. This problem was addressed with a design-for-manufacturing approach, novel solutions for robot mechanisms, and by a wide use of polymeric materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project was of a rather large scale, involving over 30 people working in 7 different institutions in different geographical locations (Italy, Spain, Switzerland and New Zealand). The total budget of the project was around 1.1Mâ‚¬ (including personnel, consumables, and external services).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first complete robot prototype was demonstrated in April 2016, just 16 months after the beginning of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>iCub</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The iCub is a 53DOF open-source humanoid robot. Since 2007 In the years from 2007 to 2019 I have been heavily involved in the design and testing of several of its parts. Among these, the upper-body, the legs, the six-axis force-torque sensors, the covers, the legs, the hands and forearms, and the head. Since 2010, until September 2019 I have served the role of hardware lead of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More details about the robot can be found on the project website: &lt;a href=&#34;www.icub.org&#34;&gt;www.icub.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
