As a roboticist I've always been fascinated and surprised by the extremely cool stuff that is done by animatronics artists. In a certain sense what they do and what we do in the humanoids research community is rather similar as we both strive to create artificial system capable of replicating the characteristics of natural ones. I therefore decided to spend a bit of time to analyze the animatronic "design" approach; here are a short report, and some references.

## Sources

Unfortunately for what concerns animatronics not many of the traditional sources of information are available.
A preliminary Google search does not seem to show any evidence of a consolidated and coherent corpus of knowledge on the topic.
Detailed descriptions of hardware implementations are lacking, so as patents filed.
Most information is available as photographs or video showreels on the websites of the artists and companies that create these devices for the entertainment industry.

## Design approach

Animatronics employs mostly either hydraulic or electric actuation. Hydraulic actuation is preferred for moving big and heavy systems. Electric actuation is instead preferred for smaller systems.
For some details regarding hydraulic animatronics I highly recommend watching the Stan Winston School "making of" videos of the original 1993 Jurassic Park T-Rex ([video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SK1qTnhHzI) and [video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoswY2-1AbM)).
In this post I will however mainly describe small-scale systems because I find them more related to normal robots.

Most electric animatronic systems are actuated by servo-motors. These have the great advantage of being relatively inexpensive and extremely easy to control.
Servos are then connected to driven joints with linkages terminated with ball-in-socket joints.
The use of ball-in-socket joints is important since it allows to prevent the onset of kinematic singularities.
The use of linkages is also important because it allows fast design iterations. If a given motion is not it can be easily modified by varying the linkage length. This modification can be carried out rather easily because it basically only requires changing the length of a rod, and complex components (i.e. the servos) are not modified in the process.

A few images taken from demo videos are shown hereafter.

Medium-scale systems are often cable-driven. An interesting example is the Apatosaurus model developed by Legacy Effects for the movie Jurassic World.

As can be seen the frame is composed of crossed-four-bar linkages (seemingly aluminum).
The transmission relies on steel pull-pull cables acting on pulleys (diameter around 150mm).
Three of these cable-pulley systems are integrated in the neck to provide a 3DOF roll-pithc-yaw joint.
Some of the four bar linkages comprise springs, presumably for balancing statically the system.

## Differences with respect to robotics

Robotic systems and animatronic ones differ in two main aspects: the way systems interact with the environment and the way systems are controlled.

Regarding the first point animatronic systems are generally not required to interact with the environment or to carry significant payloads. In practice the actuators are only required to move the system itself. Compared to robots, this reduces the amount of force that needs to be generated by the actuators, that reflects into lighter designs which tend to have a much slender appearance.

Secondly, and most importantly animatronic systems are normaly only position/velocity controlled and most of them are controlled without a feedback loop.
Little does it matter if trajectories are not tracked accurately since motions are generally hand-crafted.
For this reason an accurate description of the kinematics of the system if often not necessary.
This allows designers to adopt complex kinematic layouts that are generally avoided in robots because of control reasons. This aspect is particularly interesting because it evidences a classic trade-off in the design of robotic systems.
In striking a balance between performance and control complexity, it is generally preferred to limit control complexity by adopting simple robot kinematics. For example designs with linkages, and parallel mechanisms are avoided.
This constraint is not as problematic in the case of animatronic systems, thus leading to more complex, but more natural-looking solutions.
