A few days ago I was re-reading [Shuuji Kajita](https://staff.aist.go.jp/s.kajita/index-e.html)'s 2001 [paper][kajita_01] on the Linear Inverted Pendulum Mode (3D-LIMP) control.
While going through it I noticed the experiments were first carried out on the Meltran V biped robot which I did not know much about.

## Robot design

The project dates back to 2001/2002, that is more than 15 years from now.
It is thus not simple to find and retrieve information regarding the robot.
The most detailed source on this system is the 2002 paper titled [Structure and locomotive modes of a self-contained biped leg-wheeled system][matsumoto_02] by Matsumoto et al. published in the book titled "[Climbing and Walking Robots and the Support Technologies for Mobile Machines][bidaud_02]", edited by Phillippe Bidaud and Faiz Ben Amar in 2002.
The paper contains a detailed description of the robot.

> [...] the length (300mm) and width (500mm) of the body is small.
[...] the hardware design accommodates the installation of batteries and wireless LAN to realize a self-contained system.
>
>The total height is variable from 1200mm (min.) to 1500mm (max.) depending on the length of the telescopic legs. The total weight of the system is 60kg. Two DC servo motors (90W) with harmonic drive gears are attached to the upper part of each leg for driving joint 1 (roll) and joint 2 (pitch). A DC servo motor (150W) with a ball-screw mechanism is installed in the model of the leg to lengthen an shorten it (joint 3).
A DC servo motors (90W) with harmonic drive gears is attached to the lower part of the leg for driving joint 4 (roll). Joint 5 is a passive joint with a brake on the yaw axis. Two DC servo motors (90W) with harmonic drive gears are attached to the wheel part for driving the two wheels independently. The passive joint 5 is driven by the differential rotation of the two wheels while thy are both in contact with the ground. A rotary encoder is attached to each motor and passive joint for sensing the rotation angle. Two rate gyroscopes and two accelerometers are attached to the body for sensing the angular velocity and acceleration respectively in the pitch and roll directions. A torque sensor that measures the forces on 3 directions (x, y, z) and moments around 3 axes (pitch, roll, yaw) is attached to the lower part of each leg.
>
> The body houses twelve amplifiers for the DC servo motors, the sensor systems mentioned above and five electric circuit boards (a CPU board (200MHx Pentium), an IO boards, a network board and two boards for the torque sensor systems). The operating system on the CPU is RT-LINUX to achieve a fast servo cycle. The human operator can communicate externally with the CPU over a network using a personal computer.

The most interesting feature of the robot are its telescoping legs. The first two legs DOF allow to set the contact point direction, whereas the third allows to bring the "foot" into contact.
This design choice allows to decouple the selection of the foot position from the control of the leg extension, which is not normally the case in legged systems with knees.
Furthermore the absence of knee DOF removes the stretched-knee kinematic singular configuration.

Most interestingly this kinematic layout is strikingly similar to the one selected for the [Schaft biped](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyZE0psQsX0) unveiled last year at NEST2016.

Possibly the most important difference between the two systems (besides the absence of wheels of the Schaft robot), is the presence of a first yaw axis on each leg of the Schaft biped, which allows to rotate the legs along their vertical axis.

As it often happens in technology, new designs are often incremental advances of the state of the art.
