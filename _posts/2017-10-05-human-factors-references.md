When designing systems to be used by people of to be operated near them it is often useful to have specifications regarding human dimensions (a.k.a. anthropometry), biomechanics, and performance capabilities. In this post I collected some relevant references.

Most documents freely available on-line were developed by USA institutions such as NASA, the FAA and the DoD.

## NASA standards

Indeed most of these seem to have originated from the [NASA-STD-3000 "Man-System Integration Standard" (MSIS)](NASA-STD-3000), that was first published in 1987.

The NASA-STD-3000 "Man-System Integration Standard" was later superseded by the [NASA-SP-2010-3407 "Human Integration Design Handbook"](NASA-SP-2010-3407).

NASA also recently developed a [standard specific for the Constellation Program CxP](CxP70024E).

## DoD standard

[MIL-STD-1472D human engineering design criteria standard](MIL-STD-1472) was promulgated in March 1989 and addressed the level of technology that existed through 1987 or 1988.
Its content on biomechanics and anthropometry is substantially similar to the one found in NASA-STD-3000 MSIS.

## Other sources

In 2003 the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) its [HF-STD-001 Human Factors Design Standard](HF-STD-001) released the with the intention of providing reference information to assist in the selection, analysis, design, development, and evaluation of new and modified systems and equipment.

Another interesting resource is the EverySpec website that contains a database of government and military standards, specifications, handbooks, and documents; a specific [section dedicated to human-factors](everyspec-HFAC) is available.

Besides these documents, that can be obtained for free, a number of human-factors books are available for [purchase](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=human+factors).

## What about kids?

A final remark. Since most of the equipment developed for NASA, DoD and the FAA is (kind of obviously) not intended to be operated by minors there is no information available on the anthropometry of youngsters in the standards cited so far. The same holds for the content of human-factors books, that mostly cover general and work ergonomics.

An exception is "[The measure of man & woman](dreyfuss_59)" by Henry Dreyfuss Associates, which is one of the few sources that contains data on children (as well as elderly people).
