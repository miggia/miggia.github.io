A while ago I decided to create my webpage on [GitHub](https://github.com) and eventually write some blog posts. 
I then started to figure out how to do it. Here are some notes.

## why static?

I remeber reading a blog post on the [Otherlabs blog](https://otherlab.com/blog) (love their work) talking about how their old dynamic blog was hacked, and why it is good to go static.

Can't find the exact post but it sounded kind of convincing, so here am I tinkering with Jekyll.

## which platform?

As of today (06.10.16) [StaticGen](https://www.staticgen.com/) lists Jekyll as the most used static site generator.
Furthermore:
* its issue count has a decreasing trend
* it is nicely integrated with [GitHub](https://github.io)

## which theme
I'm pretty much for a minimal theme.

Fortunately there are a bunch of good templates; here are some of the ones I like best:

1. https://github.com/volny/stylish-portfolio-jekyll
2. https://github.com/brianmaierjr/long-haul
3. https://github.com/jeromelachaud/freelancer-theme
4. https://github.com/SpaceG/library
5. https://github.com/vincentchan/mickey

## baby steps

So... the only thing left is to start.

A super useful reference in this case is this [guide by Jonathan McGlone](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/); very easy for newbies like me.
