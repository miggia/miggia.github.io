After deciding to use Jekyll I set out to decide which theme to use.

I was pretty much for a minimal theme, with no Javascript and no complex styling.

After quite some searching I found the following themes to match my preferences best:

* [Scribble](https://github.com/muan/scribble)
* [Jekyll-Mono](https://github.com/AkshayAgarwal007/Jekyll-Mono)
* [Phantom](https://github.com/jamigibbs/phantom)

All of the three are great designs, but Jekyll-Mono seemed the easiest to work with, so I forked it, and started tweaking it.

I'm practically done, and quite happy with how things look.
