Carbon fiber was selected as the reinforcement and used in the form of both short and continuous fibers embedded in the Nylon-6 matrix, forming the composite's hybrid structure. An approach based on progressive improvement of surface treatment effectiveness (solvent degreasing, abrasion, and low-pressure plasma) has been adopted to verify how the additively-manufactured composite responds to bonding when increased interfacial adhesion is attained by preparing the outer printed layer. Roughness measurements, wettability evaluations, and XPS analyses have been carried out to assess any modifications of morphology and functionalization exhibited by the different surfaces after treatment. The experimental findings demonstrate that the intrinsic non-homogeneity of 3D-printed composites is emphasized when low-pressure plasma is used, as it generates interfacial bonds between adhesive and adherend that are more effective than the interlaminar ones within the substrate. In this condition, the ultimate resistance of the joint corresponds to that of the base material. In particular, fracture-mechanism analysis allowed precise identification of the crack path, highlighting defects and current limitations of the additively-manufactured system and suggesting pivotal aspects to develop in future work to improve joint performance.","tags":null,"title":"Adhesive bonding of a mixed short and continuous carbon-fiber-reinforced Nylon-6 composite made via fused filament fabrication","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.

Lately, these technologies have been combined practically allowing the fabrication of continuous-fiber reinforced polymer parts via 3D-printing. This topic is gaining attention both in the research community and among industrial users. Because of their novelty, such manufacturing methods are, however, still not thoroughly understood, and their performance limits have not yet been fully characterized. This study aims at analyzing the mechanical resistance of components made with continuous carbon fiber (CCF) thermoplastic materials by means of fused filament fabrication (FFF), focusing on the influence of the fiber orientation on such properties. In particular, both the tensile and the bending characteristics are evaluated according to the relative test standards, in specimens with both unidirectional and mixed-isotropic configurations. The experimental findings are compared with a set of reference specimens made with a base polymer filled with chopped \"short\" carbon fibers, allowing one to appreciate the advantages or limitations of the different fiber arrangements.","tags":null,"title":"Effect of the fiber orientation on the tensile and flexural behavior of continuous carbon fiber composites made via fused filament fabrication","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The recent advent of Additive Manufacturing (AM) has fundamentally changed the way we manufacture things.

The clever application of AM can, however, overcome part of these difficulties. For example, robots with lower part counts can be designed specifically for AM, requiring little or no assembly operations. Furthermore, compliant joints can be used to replace traditional multi-part revolute or linear joints. Finally, the local tuning of material properties is now possible, thanks to the advent of new machines allowing fabrication with multiple materials and long-fibre composites.

From a mechanical standpoint, the introduced novelty resides in two parallel non-linear springs connecting the internal motor-gear groups to the actuator frame. These additional elastic elements create a closed force path that mechanically attenuates the effects of external noise. We further explore the properties of this novel actuator by modeling the effect of gears static frictions on the output joint equilibrium position during the co-contraction of the agonist and antagonist side of the actuator. As a result, we found an analytical condition on the spring potential energies to guarantee that co-activation reduces the effect of friction on the joint equilibrium position. The design of an optimized set of springs respecting this condition leads to the construction of a prototype of our actuator. To conclude the work, we also present two control solutions that exploit the mechanical design of the actuator allowing to control both the joint stiffness and the joint equilibrium position.","tags":null,"title":"Design and Control of a Passive Noise Rejecting Variable Stiffness Actuator","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.

In this article, we considered a class of 2-DOF spherical six-bar mechanisms. We first developed the kinematic model of the system. We then tackled both the workspace limitation and uniformity issues with a numerical optimization approach. Differential evolution (a multi-objective, multivariate, gradient-free optimization method) was applied to the model of the system to explore a large space of parameter combinations. The optimization algorithm allowed obtaining an almost uniform and large RoM (exceeding 50°on both axes).

However, despite the presence of many devices, user acceptance is low. Not only are visually impaired adults not using these devices but they are also too complex for children. The majority of these devices have been developed without considering either the brain mechanisms underlying the deficit or the natural ability of the brain to process information. Most of them use complex feedback systems and overwhelm sensory, attentional and memory capacities. Here we review the neuroscientific studies on orientation and mobility in visually impaired adults and children and present the technological devices developed so far to improve locomotion skills. We also discuss how we think these solutions could be improved. We hope that this paper may be of interest to neuroscientists and technologists and it will provide a common background to develop new science-driven technology, more accepted by visually impaired adults and suitable for children with visual disabilities.","tags":null,"title":"From science to technology: Orientation and mobility in blind children and adults","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hagen Lehmann","Anand Vazhapilli Sureshbabu","Alberto Parmiggiani","Giorgio Metta"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"1e70b0dc3209f3288c137622a8ad12bd","permalink":"https://miggia.github.io/publication/lehmann-16-head/","publishdate":"2021-05-26T14:11:13.758044Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lehmann-16-head/","section":"publication","summary":"The design process of robotic faces as focal points of human-robot interactions plays a very important role in the construction of successful robot companions.

Robots are now common in large manufacturing plants and other industrial settings, safely confined in closed work cells. But to be even more helpful, robots need the capability of interacting physically with humans, and with unstructured environments. This poses new challenges in the design of safe robotic systems. In this article we addressed this problem by proposing a novel design for the joints of the iCub robot. The new design provides the robot with an overload protection mechanism. The overload protection acts as a \"passive\" torque saturator, which is intrinsically safe. We constructed a prototype of a robotic joint that implements this approach. We first show that our solution is effective in a typical impact scenario. We then evaluate the possible problems arising when the device is controlled with a position control loop. We show that a conventional feedback control loop can trigger positive feedback and instability. Operating the actuator in these conditions is dangerous and can lead to severe failures. We therefore propose the implementation of a relatively simple control strategy that allows to avoid this situation by monitoring slippage, without additional sensors. The quantitative evaluations in the paper demonstrate that our approach is effective and can improve the robustness and safety of complex robotic systems. Indeed these aspects are particularly critical in the case of humaniod robots that are systems prone to severe whole-body impacts in unstructured environments (e.g. falling).","tags":null,"title":"An alternative approach to robot safety","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alberto Parmiggiani","Marco Randazzo","Giorgio Metta"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"dbf74ad01882feda8aca11d0331de97f","permalink":"https://miggia.github.io/publication/parmiggiani-14-performance/","publishdate":"2021-05-26T14:11:13.774002Z","relpermalink":"/publication/parmiggiani-14-performance/","section":"publication","summary":"Harmonic Drives (HD) are commonly used in robotics because of zero-backlash and compactness.

Ranging from serial elastic actuators to different designs of variable stiffness actuators, various prototypes havebeen proposed and implemented on robots, thus allowing performance of novel and challenging tasks. Nevertheless some of these new devices often are affected by the drawbacks related to friction. In particular, static friction due to its discontinuous nature, can produce undesired behaviors that are rather difficult to compensate. In this paper we present a novel kind of passive variable stiffness actuator based on agonist-antagonist configuration. The specific design we adopted improves the capability of the systemin mechanically compensating the external disturbances, but on the other hand intensifies the effect of stiction during the co-contraction of the agonist and antagonist side of the actuator.The consequence is the appearance of a set of neutral equilibrium configurations of the output joint that we named “dead-band”. This issue is tackled analytically investigating the propagation and the distribution of the stiction components within the whole system. The result is a condition over the spring potential energies that is exploited to properly design the new non-linear springs. Eventually experimental tests are conducted on the real actuator, showing the effectiveness of our analytical approach.","tags":null,"title":"Stiction Compensation in Agonist-Antagonist Variable Stiffness Actuators","type":"publication"},{"authors":["L.

Co-activation (the simultaneous activation of both motors) increases both the joint stiffness and the joint passive noise rejection, which is the ability to reduce the effect of noise without relying on explicit feedback loops. In this paper we further explore the properties of this actuator modeling the effect of static frictions (also known as stiction) on the joint equilibrium configuration. In the proposed framework, it is observed that static friction might result in multiple equilibrium configurations for a constant actuation level; this possibility is undesirable given the characteristics of the proposed actuator.We therefore characterize how stiction acting on the two motors influences the equilibrium configurations of the actuated joint. The analysis is conducted without specifying the characteristics of the non-linear springs. This procedural choice allows to give sufficient analytical conditions to guarantee that an increased level of co-activation reduces the effects of stiction on the joint equilibrium.

The experiments consisted in perturbing a balanced posture with an impulsive force. Perturbations were applied in two different scenarios: hitting the robot on the upper body and at the support platform, thus acting above and under the actuated joint. The applied perturbations were controlled to be repeatable and the static stiffness of the rigid and elastic actuators were tuned to match. With these assumptions, static responses were the same inthe two conditions; differences appeared only during the dynamic response and are motivated by different proportions between active and passive stiffness. In both scenarios, results show that series elasticity simplifies the role of the balancing controller by low pass filtering the dynamics of the zero moment point, consistently observing a more stable balance recovery with SEA through all the experiments.","tags":null,"title":"Quantitative Evaluation of Standing Stabilization Using Stiff and Compliant Actuators.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francesco Nori","Bastien Berret","Luca Fiorio","Alberto Parmiggiani","Giulio Sandini"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356998400,"objectID":"4109f5e5e8db02438d21c4c45f28fde6","permalink":"https://miggia.github.io/publication/ep-2890527/","publishdate":"2021-05-26T14:11:13.763031Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ep-2890527/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Variable-stiffness actuator with passive disturbance rejection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["L.

Nowadays robots are excellent machines, but are still not able to interact with their surrounding environment as humans or animals do. Recent studies highlight the role played by impedance changes in the human arm during manipulation tasks. In particular the possibility to vary the stiffness of shoulder, elbow and wrist allows humans to interact easily with fast changing environments while rejecting unpredictable noise disturbances [1]. Several studies also showed how the capability of 'co-contracting' antagonistic muscles is required to interact with noisy/unpredictable environments. Starting from these premises we recently proposed novel design principles to build actuators with the ability to actively regulate the passive noise rejection (i.e. the ability to cancel the effect of disturbances without explicitly relying on feedback) [2]. In the present paper we implement these principles in the mechanical design of a novel actuator. The actuator is composed of two electric motors in agonist-antagonist configuration. The final design includes also four non-linear springs whose force-displacement characteristic has been customized on the specific application requirements. Validation of the proposed non-linear spring design has been conducted on a prototype and results are reported in this paper.

Starting form this observation, we recently designed a novel single-joint actuator (nr-VIA) based on the use of non-linear springs in agonistantagonist configuration. In this paper we discuss some control related characteristics of the proposed design. The theoretical analysis is conducted without specifying the potential energy of the springs. We first design a control law capable of monotonically increasing the joint-stiffness (i.e. disturbance rejection) without changing the joint equilibrium configuration; this result is obtained with minimal requirements on the potential energy of the springs. The same control law is then proven (under more restrictive conditions) to monotonically decrease the sensitivity of the joint equilibrium with respect to the actuation variables, a desirable property when trying to achieve a finer control over joint positioning.","tags":null,"title":"Control of a single Degree of Freedom Noise Rejecting - Variable Impedance Actuator","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alberto Parmiggiani","Marco Maggiali","Lorenzo Natale","Francesco Nori","Alexander Schmitz","Nikos Tsagarakis","Joseé Santos Viktor","Francesco Becchi","Giulio Sandini","Giorgio Metta"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325376000,"objectID":"1224fa41520e75582660d3d9d7ece76e","permalink":"https://miggia.github.io/publication/parmiggiani-12-design/","publishdate":"2021-05-26T14:11:13.76702Z","relpermalink":"/publication/parmiggiani-12-design/","section":"publication","summary":"This article describes the hardware design of the iCub humanoid robot.

A medium with higher bulk modulus such as oil/water is believed to increase pressure and force bandwidths and reduce sensitivity to load variations, as is the case with conventional hydraulic stiff actuation systems. However in this application the inherent flexibility of the muscle plays a major role. Water has been chosen because of its non-flammability, environmental friendliness and the low solubility of air in it. The operating pressure range of the pneumatic muscle is 0-6 bar (typical range of a pneumatic system) that is well below typical operating pressures of hydraulic systems (typically over 100 bar). At such low pressures the dynamic behaviour of water is less predictable because of the higher likelihood of entrapped air in the water which physically occurs when operating at low pressures. This can majorly affect water bulk modulus and hence its dynamic performance. Therefore, the behaviour of the system in this unconventional pressure range for a liquid must be more thoroughly investigated. Theoretical and experimental analyses on a dedicated test rig have been carried out to assess these assumptions.","tags":null,"title":"Water/air performance analysis of a fluidic muscle","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

Although quite specific to the robotic setup that we considered the work we describe shows some insights that could be useful for the control and realization of similar structures actuated with tendons.","tags":null,"title":"A force sensor for the control of a human-like tendon driven neck","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alberto Parmiggiani","Marco Randazzo","Lorenzo Natale","Giorgio Metta","Giulio Sandini"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1230768000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1230768000,"objectID":"1f5790439fb0200b227abdcc04b2f308","permalink":"https://miggia.github.io/publication/parmiggiani-09-joint/","publishdate":"2021-05-26T14:11:13.776994Z","relpermalink":"/publication/parmiggiani-09-joint/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper describes the design and integration of three joint torque sensors on the arm of the iCub platform [1], [2]. The objective is to enhance the robot arm with joint torque control capability. This activity is part of a general upgrade of the humanoid robot to provide the its 53 degrees of freedom low-level joint torque control capabilities. In particular, the shoulder joint is challenging because of its complex and compact mechanical structure. We first modeled the behaviour of the sensors with analytical equations and the sensor geometry were subsequently optimized using finite element structural simulations. The sensors were then constructed, and integrated in the arm assembly. Finally we present preliminary experiments to validate the design.","tags":null,"title":"Joint torque sensing for the upper-body of the iCub humanoid robot","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The iCub is a 53DOF open-source humanoid robot.
